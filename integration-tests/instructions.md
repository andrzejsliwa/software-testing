## Integration Tests

To view lecture notes for this course, please consult the [github-pages](https://jbelmont.github.io/software-testing).

## Distinction between Unit Tests
*Introducing dependencies on external modules or data also turns unit tests into integration tests.*

*If one module misbehaves in a chain of interrelated modules, it is not so immediately clear where to look for the cause of the failure.*
*When code under development relies on a database, a web service, or any other external process or service,*
*enforcing a unit-testable separation is also an opportunity and a driving force to design more modular, more testable and more reusable code.*

## Starting instructions
* Open 2 terminal prompts
* run the command `couchdb`
* `cd integration-tests`
### II. Using text editor of your choice open program.test.js and complete each TODO block.

### 1. Finish Integration test for the /api/v1/users/badMofos endpoint:

#### Inspect the payload with the following curl command
```sh
curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users/badMofos"
```
#### Use the telnet command and paste in the following commands to your terminal and hit enter.
```sh
telnet localhost 3000
```

Paste this GET request into terminal that is expecting request and line feed and hit enter twice
```sh
GET /api/v1/users/badMofos HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Accept: application/json
Cache-Control: no-cache
Postman-Token: f3413251-c0de-69ac-99dd-992bcaaca3bd
```

#### Use a REST client such as Postman Chrome App or anything else.

##### Whichever way you use choose you get the following JSON payload
```json
{
  "_id": "users",
  "_rev": "1-c9d988323eed080b054d6eb467abe4f9",
  "names": [
    "John J Rambo",
    "Conan The Barbarian",
    "Billy Jack"
  ],
  "ranks": [
    "One Bad Mofo",
    "Too Big of a dude",
    "Kicks too high for my taste"
  ]
}
```

* Add assertion to expect function call in line 16 using the payload information.

### 2. Finish Integration Test for /api/v1/couch/insertDocument endpoint

*The Super Test library api docs can be found here [SuperTest](https://visionmedia.github.io/superagent)*

####Hints to complete the exercise:
*1. Use post method in supertest*
*2. Use set method in supertest and pass in object with Accept and Content-Type headers.*
*3. Use send method in supertest and pass in object with a name and document property.*
*4. Make sure to call expect in supertest to do assertion and use previous get request as example.*
*5. Make sure to end supertest call with end function call or the integration test won't finish.*
*6. Check statuscode with SuperTest property [Status](https://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/#response-status)*
*7. Use assertion methods from Tape [Asserts](http://www.node-tap.org/asserts)*
*8. CouchDB api documentation [Docs](https://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/HTTP_Document_API)*
*9. CouchDB driver for node.js (nano) that I am using [Docs](https://github.com/dscape/nano)*

#### Making Rest Call with Curl for Post Request
```sh
curl -X POST -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" -d '{
	"name": "some-document",
	"document": {
		"values": {
			"one": 1
		}
	}
}' "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/couch/insertDocument"
```

### 3. Write an integration test removing the newly created document to /api/v1/couch/deleteDocument/:name

*The Super Test library api docs and rest methods can be found here [SuperTest](https://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/#request-basics)*

####Hints to complete the exercise:
*1. Use appropriate supertest method to remove document.*
*2. Make assertion with the returned status code (204) is usual status for DELETE request.*

#### Making Rest Call with Curl for Delete Request
```sh
curl -X DELETE -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
	"name": "spicegirls"
}' "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/couch/deleteDocument"
```
